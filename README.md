# Sports-Club-Management

The Sports club management system categorizes its visitors into different
categories and presents them with the respective functionality as per their
level of access. A new user can either register for club membership or book
the ground for the desired number of days. A new user can also enroll in the
activities of the sports club. A detailed cost evaluation is done by the
software when the user tries to book the ground. The user sees the estimated
cost clearly at the time of booking. This prevents the users from negotiating
about cost afterwards. A user who is already a member of the club doesn’t
need to register before booking the ground. Apart from the functionalities
mentioned above, the users can register themselves for the various regular
and vacation training batches
